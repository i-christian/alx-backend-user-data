## Description
In this project, you will learn about Basic Authentication and its implementation on a simple API. You'll explore various concepts such as authentication mechanisms, Base64 encoding, HTTP headers, and more.

## Resources
Read or watch:
- [REST API Authentication Mechanisms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=501dpx2IjGY)
- [Base64 in Python](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/base64.html)
- [HTTP header Authorization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization)
- [Flask Documentation](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)
- [Base64 - Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What authentication means
- What Base64 is and how to encode a string in Base64
- What Basic authentication means and how to send the Authorization header

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have documentation
- All your classes should have documentation
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation

## Tasks
